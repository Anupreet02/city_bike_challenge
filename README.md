* [ ] Overview
  Welcome to the Citi Bike Program Analysis! This project aims to provide insights into the usage of the Citi Bike program in New York City by aggregating and visualizing trip data collected since 2013. As the lead analyst, I have created a set of reports to help city officials understand ridership trends, peak usage times, and popular bike stations.

This analysis utilizes data from the Citi Bike Trip History Logs, focusing on the most recent year to ensure consistency in data structure and relevance. Through this project, we aim to identify two unexpected phenomena regarding bike usage and present them through engaging visualizations.

Project Components

Data Files: Selected datasets were downloaded from the Citi Bike Data website. Each file contains trip history logs that include relevant columns such as start and end station, trip duration, user type, and bike ID.
Note: Only 1-3 zip files were downloaded to maintain optimal file sizes for Tableau.

Visualizations: A total of 8-10 visualizations have been created to illustrate the identified phenomena. These visualizations provide insights into various aspects of the Citi Bike program, including: Total trips recorded,  Growth in ridership, Proportions of user types, Peak usage hours for different seasons, Top and bottom stations for starting and ending journeys, Average trip duration by user type

Maps: A static map showcasing the most popular bike stations for starting and ending journeys, with zip code data overlaid.

Dashboards: Each phenomenon identified in the analysis is represented by a dedicated dashboard, which combines multiple visualizations to provide a comprehensive view. These dashboards are accompanied by analyses explaining potential causes for the observed trends.

Tableau Story: A cohesive Tableau story that integrates all visualizations, maps, and dashboards. This story serves to narrate the findings in a professional and engaging manner, tailored for city officials and public administrators.

Engage with the Visualizations: Many visualizations are interactive. Filter by user type, date ranges, or stations to drill down into specific insights.

Goals of the Analysis: The ultimate aim of this project is to equip city officials with clear, actionable insights that can help improve the Citi Bike program. By presenting data in a visually compelling manner, we hope to facilitate informed decision-making regarding bike-sharing infrastructure, marketing strategies, and user engagement.
